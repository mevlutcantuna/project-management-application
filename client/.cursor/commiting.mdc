# Commit Messages & Design Conversion

## Commit Message Format

- Always use the **conventional commits format**: `type(scope): description`.
  - Common types include: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`.
- Messages must be concise, clear, in the present tense, and use simple, descriptive language.
- Avoid jargon unless necessary for technical clarity.

## Examples

- `feat(auth): add login form validation`
- `fix(forms): resolve form submission error handling`
- `test(invoice): add integration tests for invoice management`
- `refactor(components): extract reusable SearchableSelect component`
